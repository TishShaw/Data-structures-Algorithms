// BreadthFirstSearch 
    //starts at the top

// DepthFirstSearch
    // starts at the bottom to top
    // starts at the smallest node to the left.

    // Preorder
        // start at the top then go to the left and left come up to the right
        // next goes to the right of the root node and goes left then comes back up to the right

    // PostOrder
        // visits each node until there is no children, then writes its value to the array.

    //InOrder
        // visit each node to the left first
        // writes that value to the array
        // then tries to go right
        // if there is nothhing to thr right, it goes back up
        // writes that vale then goes right
        // check for left children go up write the value then tries to go right
